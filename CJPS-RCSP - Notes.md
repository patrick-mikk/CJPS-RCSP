# Canadian Journal of Political Science Citation Style: A Comprehensive Guide

The CJPS style is designed to maintain clarity, consistency, and accuracy in scholarly writing. It is used primarily for articles in the Canadian Journal of Political Science and follows an author–date, parenthetical citation system. This guide details every element—from citing sources within the text to formatting your bibliography—ensuring that your work conforms to CJPS standards.

## 1. Editorial Policy

- The CJPS employs a **double-blind review process** with at least two reviews for every submission.
- Manuscripts are initially evaluated by the Editors based on their contribution to the discipline and adherence to scholarly standards.
- Manuscripts may be rejected if they are too narrow or specialized for an omnibus political science journal like CJPS.
- Only manuscripts of sufficient quality will be sent out for peer review.
- The CJPS considers manuscripts on an exclusive basis only; submitted manuscripts must not be previously published, under consideration, or accepted for publication elsewhere.
- Authors of accepted manuscripts with empirical research are strongly encouraged to submit their original datasets and replication codes to publicly accessible repositories (e.g., Harvard Dataverse).
- CJPS is a hybrid journal, offering both subscription-based access and open access options for authors.

## 4. General Principles of Citation

- **Author–Date System:**  
  All citations within the text are provided in parentheses, indicating the author's last name, year of publication, and page number where relevant.
  
- **No Footnotes for Citations:**  
  Unlike some styles (e.g., Chicago's note–bibliography system), CJPS does not use footnotes for referencing. Citations appear in the text and in the reference list.
  
- **Only Cited Sources:**  
  Only works cited within the text should appear in the reference list (titled "References").

---

## 5. In–Text Citations

### 5.1 Format

- **Basic Structure:**  
  A parenthetical citation should include the author's last name and publication year. If a page number is applicable, it follows the year after a colon.  
  **Example:**  
  - General reference:  
    `(Cairns, 1968)`  
  - With page number:  
    `(Cairns, 1968: 78)`

- **When the Author's Name Appears in the Sentence:**  
  If the author's name is mentioned in your prose, omit it from the parenthetical citation.  
  **Example:**  
  - "According to Alan Cairns, 'the electoral system has been an important factor…' (1968: 78)."

### 5.2 Multiple Authors

- **Two Authors:**  
  Include both names separated by "and".  
  **Example:**  
  `(Tanguay and Gagnon, 1996: 3)`

- **Three or More Authors:**  
  List the first author's last name followed by "et al."  
  **Example:**  
  `(Lambert et al., 1986)`

### 5.3 Multiple Works by the Same Author in the Same Year

- **Differentiation with Suffixes:**  
  If you cite more than one work by the same author published in the same year, assign lowercase letter suffixes immediately after the year.  
  **Example:**  
  `(Lambert et al., 1986a); (Lambert et al., 1986b)`

### 5.4 Multiple Sources in a Single Citation

- **Listing Several Works:**  
  When several sources support a single point, list them in alphabetical order, separated by semicolons.  
  **Example:**  
  `(Irvine, 1974; Irvine and Gold, 1980; Johnston, 1985; Meisel, 1967, 1975)`

### 5.5 Special Cases

- **Institutional or Anonymous Sources:**  
  When a source does not have a personal author, use the institution's name in place of an author.  
  **Example:**  
  `(City of St. Catharines, 1982: 2)`

- **Court Cases:**  
  Include enough information within the text to locate the corresponding entry in the reference list.  
  **Example:**  
  `(Operation Dismantle v. The Queen, 1985)`  

- **Inserting Brief Phrases:**  
  Occasionally, you might include a brief comment within the parentheses.  
  **Example:**  
  `(but see Lambert et al., 1986a)`

## 6. Reference List (Bibliography)

The reference list should appear at the end of your paper under the heading "References" and include only the sources cited in your text.

### 6.1 General Formatting Rules

- **Alphabetical Order:**  
  Arrange entries alphabetically by the author's last name.
  
- **Full Names:**  
  Use upper- and lower-case for authors' names exactly as they appear in the work. List all names for co-authored works.
  
- **Chronological Order for Same Authors:**  
  If you have several works by the same author, list them chronologically, using letter suffixes for works published in the same year.

## 7. Special Formatting and Language Guidelines

### 7.1 Spelling and Language

- **Canadian Spelling:**  
  Follow Canadian spelling conventions (e.g., "behaviour," "labour," "centre").
  
- **Gender-Neutral Language:**  
  Use gender-neutral and inclusive language throughout.

### 7.2 Hyphenation and Compound Terms

- **General Rule:**  
  Avoid unnecessary hyphenation. However, use a hyphen when:
  - The prefix ends with the same vowel as the beginning of the word that follows (e.g., co-editor).
  - Clarity demands it (e.g., pre-empt, neo-institutional).

### 7.3 Numbers and Dates

- **Numbers:**  
  Spell out numbers less than 10; use numerals from 10 onward.
  
- **Date Formatting:**  
  - Full years in ranges: 1980-1993 (not 1980-93)
  - Specific dates: Month Day, Year (e.g., July 1, 2003)
  - Decades: 1990s (not 1990's)

### 7.4 Abbreviations and Latin Terms

- **Abbreviations:**  
  Do not use periods in standard abbreviations (e.g., MP, MPP, NDP, PQ, USA, OECD).
  
- **Latin Terms:**  
  Use full expressions rather than abbreviations (e.g., "for example" instead of "e.g.").

### 7.5 Titles and Capitalization

- **Book titles and journal names:** In italics
- **Article titles:** In quotation marks
- **Capitalize** all major words in titles
- **Avoid** unnecessary capitalization in general text

## 8. Tips for Applying the CJPS Style

- **Consult Official Sources:**  
  Always refer to the official CJPS Instructions for Contributors and the CPSA Editorial Style Guidelines for the most authoritative guidance.

- **Use Reference Management Software:**  
  Tools like Zotero or Mendeley can help automate formatting if you use the correct CSL style.

- **Consistency is Key:**  
  Maintain consistent formatting throughout your document, especially in citations and references.

- **Validate Your CSL File:**  
  If using a CSL file with reference management software, validate it using the [CSL Validator](https://validator.citationstyles.org/).
