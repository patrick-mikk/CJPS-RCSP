# Canadian Journal of Political Science Citation Style: A Comprehensive Guide

The CJPS style is designed to maintain clarity, consistency, and accuracy in scholarly writing. It is used primarily for articles in the Canadian Journal of Political Science and follows an author–date, parenthetical citation system. This guide details every element—from citing sources within the text to formatting your bibliography—ensuring that your work conforms to CJPS standards.

---

## 1. General Principles

- **Author–Date System:**  
  All citations within the text are provided in parentheses, indicating the author’s last name, the year of publication, and, where relevant, the specific page number or locator.
  
- **No Footnotes for Citations:**  
  Unlike some other styles (e.g., Chicago’s note–bibliography system), CJPS does not use footnotes for referencing. All credit is given in the text and in the reference list.
  
- **Only Cited Sources:**  
  Only those works cited within the text should appear in the reference list (titled “References”).

---

## 2. In–Text Citations

### 2.1 Format

- **Basic Structure:**  
  A parenthetical citation should include the author’s last name and publication year. If a page number is applicable (for direct quotes, specific statistics, or a paraphrase where a precise reference is needed), it follows the year after a colon.  
  **Example:**  
  - General reference:  
    `(Cairns, 1968)`  
  - With page number:  
    `(Cairns, 1968: 78)`

- **When the Author’s Name Appears in the Sentence:**  
  If the author’s name is mentioned in your prose, omit it from the parenthetical citation. Only the year (and page number if needed) is provided in parentheses.  
  **Example:**  
  - “According to Alan Cairns, ‘the electoral system has been an important factor…’ (1968: 78).”

### 2.2 Multiple Authors

- **Two Authors:**  
  Include both names separated by “and”.  
  **Example:**  
  `(Tanguay and Gagnon, 1996: 3)`

- **Three or More Authors:**  
  List the first author’s last name followed by “et al.”  
  **Example:**  
  `(Lambert et al., 1986)`

### 2.3 Multiple Works by the Same Author in the Same Year

- **Differentiation with Suffixes:**  
  If you cite more than one work by the same author published in the same year, assign lowercase letter suffixes immediately after the year (e.g., 1986a, 1986b).  
  **Example:**  
  `(Lambert et al., 1986a); (Lambert et al., 1986b)`

### 2.4 Multiple Sources in a Single Citation

- **Listing Several Works:**  
  When several sources support a single point, list them in alphabetical order, separated by semicolons. If the list is not meant to be exhaustive, it should be preceded by “for example.”  
  **Example:**  
  `(for example, Irvine, 1974; Irvine and Gold, 1980; Johnston, 1985; Meisel, 1967, 1975)`

### 2.5 Special Cases

- **Institutional or Anonymous Sources:**  
  When a source does not have a personal author, use the institution’s name in place of an author.  
  **Example:**  
  `(City of St. Catharines, 1982: 2)`

- **Court Cases:**  
  For court cases, include enough information within the text so the reader can locate the corresponding entry in the reference list.  
  **Example:**  
  `(Operation Dismantle v. The Queen, 1985)`  
  or  
  `(U.S. Supreme Court, Gregg v. Georgia, 1976)`

- **Inserting Brief Phrases:**  
  Occasionally, you might include a brief comment within the parentheses.  
  **Example:**  
  `(but see Lambert et al., 1986a)`

## 3. Reference List (Bibliography)

The reference list should appear at the end of your paper under the heading “References.” It must include only the sources that you have cited in your text.

### 3.1 General Formatting Rules

- **Alphabetical Order:**  
  Arrange entries alphabetically by the author’s last name. When dealing with names that include particles (e.g., “De,” “Mc”), follow the specific sorting rules provided by CJPS.
  
- **Full Names:**  
  Use upper- and lower-case for authors’ names exactly as they appear in the work. In the case of multiple authors, list all names for co-authored works.
  
- **Chronological Order for Same Authors:**  
  If you have several works by the same author, list them in chronological order. Use letter suffixes (a, b, c) for works published in the same year.

### 3.2 Detailed Formats for Common Source Types

## 4. Special Formatting and Language Guidelines

### 4.1 Names and Capitalization

- **Author Names:**  
  Names should appear in upper and lower case exactly as provided. For works with multiple authors, list all names in full.
  
- **Generational Identifiers:**  
  When including generational suffixes (e.g., Jr, III), place them after the given name with a comma.  
  **Example:**  
  `Rockefeller, John D., III.`

### 4.2 Hyphenation and Compound Terms

- **General Rule:**  
  Avoid unnecessary hyphenation. However, use a hyphen when:
  - The prefix ends with the same vowel as the beginning of the word that follows (e.g., co-editor, co-author).
  - Clarity demands it (e.g., pre-empt, neo-institutional).
  
- **Exceptions:**  
  Terms like “neoliberal” are typically not hyphenated, whereas adjectives such as “policy-making” (when used adjectivally) are hyphenated.

### 4.3 Numbers and Dates

- **Numbers:**  
  Spell out numbers less than 10; use numerals from 10 onward.  
  When numbers appear in a series, use numerals consistently.
  
- **Date Formatting:**  
  - For a range of years, write out the full years (e.g., 1980–1993, not 1980–93).  
  - For specific dates, provide day, month, and year in that order (e.g., July 1, 2003).  
  - When referring to decades, write “the 1990s” (avoid apostrophes such as “1990’s”).

### 4.4 Abbreviations and Latin Terms

- **Abbreviations:**  
  Do not use periods in standard abbreviations (e.g., MP, MPP, NDP, PQ, USA, OECD).
  
- **Latin Abbreviations:**  
  Use full expressions rather than abbreviations (e.g., “for example” instead of “e.g.,” “and so forth” instead of “etc.,” “that is” instead of “i.e.”).

### 4.5 Inclusive Language

- **Gender Neutrality:**  
  The style emphasizes the use of gender-neutral language. For example, prefer “humans,” “people,” or “individuals” instead of “man” or “mankind,” unless directly quoting a source.
  
- **Capitalization:**  
  Capitalize proper nouns, titles preceding names, and certain institutional terms (e.g., “the Senate” when referring to the office), but avoid unnecessary capitalization of common nouns.

## 5. Additional Considerations from the Editorial Guidelines

While the citation style governs references and in-text citations, CJPS’s broader editorial guidelines address other manuscript elements:

- **Manuscript Length and Structure:**  
  Articles should not exceed 8,000 words, and if accepted, a French abstract will be required.

- **Tables and Figures:**  
  - Tables should be used sparingly to present key findings.  
  - Each table and figure must be submitted on separately numbered sheets and should include a clear title and source information.  
  - In-text citations in tables and figure footnotes follow the same parenthetical rules as the main text.

- **Language and Style:**  
  - The style recommends using the current edition of *The Canadian Style: A Guide to Writing and Editing* and the *Gage Canadian Dictionary*.  
  - Spellings, verb forms (e.g., “organize” vs. “organise,” “fulfilled” vs. “fulfilt”), and hyphenation should conform to the guidelines specified.
  
- **Punctuation:**  
  - Use a forward slash (e.g., left/right) for alternatives rather than a hyphen.
  - When listing items, omit the comma before the final “and” or “or” unless clarity requires it.

- **Endnotes:**  
  If used, endnotes should contain only brief, explanatory text and are placed after the main text but before the reference list.

## 6. Tips for Applying the CJPS Style

- **Consult the Originals:**  
  Always refer to the CJPS Quick Guide and the 2008 Editorial Style Guidelines for the most detailed examples and any updates.

- **Use Reference Management Software:**  
  Tools like Zotero can help automate much of the formatting if you create or adopt a CSL style that matches these specifications.

- **Review and Validate:**  
  Once your references are formatted, compare them against the examples provided in this guide to ensure full compliance. Adjust as needed to capture the nuances of each source type.

- **Keep Consistency:**  
  Consistency in citations and references not only meets CJPS standards but also improves the readability and professionalism of your manuscript.
